This folder includes examples for Adafruit Memento Camera: https://www.adafruit.com/product/5477

This runs CircuitPython instead of Arduino code, however, is very useful if you need more complex computer vision related work. It also has a camera with which you can develop applications. Please see: https://learn.adafruit.com/memento-camera-quick-start-guide/ for more detailed information about the board.

## Installing CircuitPython on Memento Camera
